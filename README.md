# Quadratic equations solver

If you have an equation of the form 'ax2 + bx + c = 0', this module can solve it for you.
Just enter the values of a, b and c as parameters.

# How to use

Example of script launch on Linux, Python 3.5:

```bash
$ python3

>>> import quadratic_equation 

>>> quadratic_equation.get_roots(1, -1, -6) 
(-2.0, 3.0)
```

# How to Launch Unit Tests

```bash
$ python3 tests.py

....
