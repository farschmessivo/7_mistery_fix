# Quadratic equations solver

If you have an equation of the form "ax2 + bx + c = 0", this module can solve it for you.
Just enter the values of a, b and c as parameters.

# How to use

Example of script launch on Linux, Python 3.5:

```bash
$ python3

import quadratic_equation

quadratic_equation.get_roots(1, -2, 1)
(1.0, None)

```

# How to Launch Unit Tests

```bash
$ python3 tests.py
```


# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
